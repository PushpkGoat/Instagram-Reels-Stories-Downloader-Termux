# Instagram-Reels-Stories-Downloader-Termux
InstaGrab is what I use to save Instagram reels and stories without dealing with sketchy websites. Just share to Termux, it downloads in the background, and files appear in your gallery. Supports private accounts, no root required, and sends a notification when done. Simple and reliable.
